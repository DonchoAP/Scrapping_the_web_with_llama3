**Project: LLaMA-powered Web Scraping and Trend Analysis**

**Overview**
---------

This project combines web scraping with natural language processing (NLP) using Meta AI's LLaMA model. The script scrapes articles, identifies relevant entities, and analyzes trends in the data.

**Features**
------------

* Web scraping of articles
* Entity recognition using LLaMA's NLU capabilities
* Trend analysis by grouping entities by type and sorting them by frequency
* Output: console log with entity types and counts

**Prerequisites**
